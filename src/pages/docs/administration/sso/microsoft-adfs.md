> **[SSO with Microsoft AD FS is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

To configure SSO with [Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/identity/active-directory-federation-services) (AD FS), you can use your Microsoft AD FS server. You must be an administrator in both Microsoft AD FS and Postman to configure SSO for your team.

Before you configure SSO with Microsoft AD FS, you must create the following:

* An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.
* An SSL certificate from the Microsoft AD FS server.
* A server that runs Microsoft Server 2012 or 2008.

After you meet these minimum requirements, install Microsoft AD FS on your server. To configure and install Microsoft AD FS, see [Deploy and configure AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/gg188612(v=crm.8)) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

## Configuring SSO with Microsoft AD FS

Before configuring your server in Microsoft AD FS, you must [configure SSO in Postman](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/). When choosing the **Authentication Type**, select **AD FS**. Name your authentication and **Continue**.

### Enable the RelayState parameter on your servers

Enable the RelayState parameter on your Microsoft AD FS servers, and then restart your service.

1. Open the configuration file.

    * For Microsoft AD FS 2.0, open the following file in a text editor:

        ```shell
        %systemroot%\inetpub\adfs\ls\web.config
        ```

    * For Microsoft AD FS 3.0, open the following file in a text editor:

        ```shell
        %systemroot%\ADFS\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config
        ```

1. In the `<microsoft.identityServer.web>` section, add a line for `<useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled="true" />` as follows, and then save the change:

    ```shell
    <microsoft.identityServer.web>
        ...
        <useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled="true" />
    </microsoft.identityServer.web>
    ```

1. For Microsoft AD FS 2.0, run `IISReset` to restart IIS.
1. For both Microsoft AD FS 2.0 and 3.0, restart the Active Directory Federation Services (`adfssrv`) service.

    > If you're using Microsoft AD FS 3.0 you only need to restart the Active Directory Federation Services (`adfssrv`) service on your Microsoft AD FS 3.0 servers, not the WAP servers.

### Submit Identity Provider details to Postman

After you configure your server, submit your identity provider's (IdP) details to Postman.

1. Download the Federation Metadata XML file from Microsoft AD FS. You can often find this file at `https://<Federation Service name>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml`.
1. In Postman, upload the Federation Metadata XML file under **Identity provider metadata** file. Or, you can enter the **SSO URL**, **Identity provider issuer**, and **X.509 Certificate** individually under **Identity provider details**.
1. Select **Save Authentication** in Postman.
